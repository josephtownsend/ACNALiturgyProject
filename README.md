# ACNALiturgyProject
A project to automatically assemble service books for the authorized public liturgies of the Anglican Church in North America, as found in the 2019 Book of Common Prayer.

Initially, my goal is the have the various pieces for the two Eucharistic liturgies put together, starting with the Revised Ancient Text, because that's what my parish uses.

Once the Eucharist liturgies are done, then I will move on to the Daily Offices. But because the Daily Office app is so excellent, I don't see that as being urgent.

Eventually the goal is to have all of the liturgies, including the special liturgies for Holy Week, the Ordinal, and the the pastoral rites, put together, such that the user can select what they are intending to do, and automatically have a service book made for them.
